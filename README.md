# c-plus-basics-and-exercises
This will be a repository where I can keep track of my progress and create exercises/solutions in C++

HOW TO CODE IN C++

I'll be recording my progress in learning C++ for the next few weeks. This will include examples of how to create strings,
basic math, algorithms and much more! I'm also creating this to help my older brother learn some programming.

CLONING REPOSITORY
If you want to learn alongside me clone this repository and create a new branch. If at any point you want to help improve my code
start by creating a pull request and I'll be sure to take a look at what you've done!
